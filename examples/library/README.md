# @vscode-logging Library DI Example

This folder contains an npm package example which uses simple constructor argument
[Dependency Injection][di] in order to use the @vscode-logging/logger in an npm library called from a VSCode Extension.

This "library" is consumed by the extension example's [passing-logger-to-library.js](../extension/lib/passing-logger-to-library.js),
file.
